# hamster-active-tracking
Active Time Tracking CLI interface for use with Project Hamster GNOME Time Tracker database

## What it does

This is a simple terminal interface that repeatedly asks you what you
are doing at a predefined time interval.

It provides autocomplete for your existing time tracking codes in the
Hamster database.

If you do not respond within a certain amount of time, it assumes you
are doing nothing and modifies your Hamster database as such.

If you are doing the same thing you were doing the last time you
answered, simply press ENTER.
